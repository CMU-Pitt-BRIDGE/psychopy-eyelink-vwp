`pyo` may require additional system dependencies. On a Mac, you can install these using Homebrew. If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can install it from https://brew.sh/.

Once Homebrew is installed, you can install the necessary dependencies. Common dependencies for audio processing include:

```bash
brew install portaudio
brew install libsndfile
```

`portaudio` is used for audio I/O.

`libsndfile` is used for reading and writing audio files.
